# portfolio-hw-2-da
This encases my work portfolio. Overtime it will be filled with different completed projects and inform you of upcoming projects. This is designed to allow you to get an introduction of me, to showcase my work, and provide you with my contact information in one location.

No installation required.

When opening the site you will come to the home page. The navigation bar currently is a placeholder for soon to be working pages. At this time I do not have completed projects so the links will not direct you to a final project, currently I have placeholders. The contact information will provide my contact information.

No license "WIP."

Kindly, Denise A
